            <p>
                Hi, I'm Vimal Suresh, You already know. I am 21 Year's old coming from Palai, Kerala. I am an engineering student hoping for a bright future and adventurous life.
                I am usually a quiet person who wants to live a decent life in a decent manner.
            </p>

            <h2 class="green-container">My Journey</h2>
            <p>
                I started my Education in 2005 when I joined kindergarten and studied my way to LP and UP in St. Thomas School Neeranthanam. A lovely and quiet school built on beautiful slopes village hill overlooking a the church tower and a church hall behind it at the top of the hill. Then I went to 
                high school in Ramapuram which named St. Augustines. I selected science for higher secondary in the same school after passing SSLC in 2018. After finishing my higher secondary, I joined St. Joseph's College of Engineering and Technology, Palai for my professional studies. I selected CS for its opportunities 
                and its creative profession. I am going to finish my professional degree 2024.
            </p>

            <h2 class="green-container">My Plan for the Future</h2>
            <p>
                Looking ahead, my plan is to be placed at a job that has a decent pay and should allow growth. I am hoping my life will be settled around late 30's years old and choose to do what I like after that. I am one of the guys that believe that doing the same job will be boring. Even if everything doesn't go according to plan,
                it's okay because life doesn't go on plan and life without struggle is not worth it.
            </p>
